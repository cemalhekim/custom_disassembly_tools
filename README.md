# Custom End Effectors for UR10e

This repository showcases the development of custom end effectors for the UR10e robotic arm, starting with a parallel gripper. The project highlights my design and engineering skills, featuring robust, modular, and customizable end effectors. Included are detailed documentation and open-source CAD files, demonstrating the integration and functionality of the end effectors with the UR10e. This work exemplifies my ability to enhance robotic capabilities and adapt designs for specific tasks.
